# Roadmap and Phases

AxiomDB is developed in phases, each of which adds a coherent vertical slice of
functionality. The design is organized in three blocks:

- **Block 1 (Phases 1–7):** Core engine — storage, indexing, WAL, transactions,
  SQL parsing, and concurrent MVCC.
- **Block 2 (Phases 8–14):** SQL completeness — full query planner, optimizer,
  advanced SQL features, and MySQL wire protocol.
- **Block 3 (Phases 15–34):** Production hardening — replication, backups, distributed
  execution, column store, and AI/ML integration.

## Current Status

**Last completed:** Phase 4 (partial) — SQL Parser + Semantic Analyzer

**Active development:** Phase 5 — Executor (planned)

## Completed Phases — Summary

### Phase 1 — Storage Engine

A generic storage layer with two implementations: `MmapStorage` for production disk
use and `MemoryStorage` for tests. Every higher-level component uses only the
`StorageEngine` trait — storage is pluggable. Pages are 16 KB with a 64-byte header
(magic, page type, CRC32c checksum, page_id, LSN, free pointers). Heap pages use a
slotted format: slots grow from the start, tuples grow from the end toward the center.

### Phase 2 — B+ Tree CoW

A persistent, Copy-on-Write B+ Tree over `StorageEngine`. Keys up to 64 bytes;
ORDER_INTERNAL = 223, ORDER_LEAF = 217 (derived to fill exactly one 16 KB page).
Root is an `AtomicU64` — readers are lock-free by design. Supports insert (with
recursive split), delete (with rebalance/redistribute/merge), and range scan via
`RangeIter`. Prefix compression for internal nodes in memory.

### Phase 3 — WAL and Transactions

Append-only Write-Ahead Log with binary entries, CRC32c checksums, and forward/backward
scan iterators. `TxnManager` coordinates BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK with snapshot assignment.
Five-step checkpoint protocol. Crash recovery state machine (five states). Catalog
bootstrap creates the three system tables on first open. `CatalogReader` provides
MVCC-consistent schema reads. Nine crash scenario tests with a post-recovery integrity
checker.

### Phase 4 — SQL Processing

SQL AST covering all DML (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and DDL (CREATE/DROP/ALTER
TABLE, CREATE/DROP INDEX). logos-based lexer with ~85 tokens, case-insensitive keywords,
zero-copy identifiers. Recursive descent parser with full expression precedence. Expression
evaluator with three-valued NULL logic (AND, OR, NOT, IS NULL, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN).
Semantic analyzer with `BindContext`, qualified/unqualified column resolution, ambiguity
detection, and subquery support. Row codec with null bitmap, u24 string lengths, and
O(n) `encoded_len()`.

## Near-Term Priorities (Phase 5)

Phase 5 will implement the executor — the component that interprets the analyzed AST
and produces result rows. Planned sub-phases:

1. **Table scan** — linear scan of heap pages with MVCC visibility filtering.
2. **Index lookup** — point lookup via B+ Tree given a primary key value.
3. **Index range scan** — range predicate via `RangeIter`.
4. **Projection** — evaluate SELECT expressions over rows from the scan.
5. **Filter** — apply WHERE expression using the evaluator from Phase 4.17.
6. **Nested loop join** — INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN.
7. **Sort** — ORDER BY with NULLS FIRST/LAST.
8. **Limit/Offset** — LIMIT n OFFSET m.
9. **Hash aggregate** — GROUP BY with COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX.
10. **INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE** — write path with WAL integration.

The executor will be a simple volcano-model interpreter in Phase 5. Vectorized
execution (morsel-driven, SIMD) is planned for Phase 14.
